# data-512-final
Final project for DATA 512 - Human Centered Data Science


## Project Preliminary Proposal


### Motivation
I am planning to do an analysis on a ML & DS dataset from Kaggle Survey.
The trends are changing very rapidly in this field, and I wanted to know the current trend as well as potential biases. These will be very useful for me to plan my next step as a data scientist. I hope to learn not only the current trend but also the past trends and why through exploring the data. (Kaggle has surveys for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 is comming soon!). In addition, I was one of the survery responder for the 2020 dataset. My overall research goal is to learn the shift of trend in current data science or machine learning field.


### Data
Here are the links to the datasets. 
These dataset contains responses for multiple choice questions as well as the text responses.
It also includes the questions as well as the schema for the survey responses. Some questions include 
- "On which platforms have you begun or completed data science courses? (Select all that apply)"
- "Which of the following machine learning frameworks do you use on a regular basis? (Select all that apply)"

#### Links to dataset
- [Kaggle ML & DS Survey 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017)
- [Kaggle ML & DS Survey 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018)
- [Kaggle ML & DS Survey 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019/data)
- 2020 data is comming soon!

All of these dataset is public and the data has been released under a CC 2.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0
These datasets are suitable for addressing my motivation because I want to learn about how other data scientists or machine learning practitioners approach problems, tools, datasets, or cloud services. 

### Unknowns
I am not sure when the 2020 version is coming out. If it does not come out, I can just work on
