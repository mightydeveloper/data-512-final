# data-512-final
Final project for DATA 512 - Human Centered Data Science


## Project Proposal

### Motivation
I am planning to do an analysis on a ML & DS dataset from Kaggle Survey. Since I am a data scientist pursuing a master's degree program in data science, it was natural for me to dive in to a data scientist dataset. Currently, I'm exploring different sub-fields within the data science realm that I can contribute to and advance my career. However, there is no standard notion on what the role of "data scientist" is, so I would like to define my own version of different sub-roles within the data scientist. (Data engineer, research engineer, data analyist, statistician, researcher, etc...)

In addition to identifying sub-fields, I want to find out past and current trend since trends are changing very rapidly in this field. These will be very useful for me to plan my next step as a data scientist. In addition to identifying trends, I would like to know why these trends occur through exploring the data. I believe I can find out some trends because Kaggle has surveys for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 is comming soon!. In addition, **I am one of the survery responder for the 2020 dataset**.

### Data
Here are the links to the datasets. 
These dataset contains responses for multiple choice questions as well as the text responses.
It also includes the questions as well as the schema for the survey responses. Some questions include 
- "On which platforms have you begun or completed data science courses? (Select all that apply)"
- "Which of the following machine learning frameworks do you use on a regular basis? (Select all that apply)"

## Research questions
1. Identify specific and distinct roles within the machine learning practitioners and data scientists and its distinct characteristics.
(Data engineer, research engineer, data analyist, statistician, researcher, etc...)

2. Identify trends within the data scientists or machine learning practitioners - which tools/frameworks they use, preferred programming language, or which cloud services they are using more often.


### Hypothesis
1. Research engineers tend to spend more time on coding/programming, while data analysts spend more time on data visualization, data engineers spend more time on data pipelines and cleaning the data. Currently, I believe there are no standard titles on these different roles.

2. Few years ago (2-3 years), I belive most machine learning engineers work on tabular dataset, then on image dataset, and since a year ago, more people start working on natural language processing (NLP).

## Methodology
I am considering to use a clustering algorithm (K-means, GMM, etc...), but also I think I'm going to analyze the data based on self-identified roles/titles. This is because self-identified roles can be considered as the ground truth. However, clustering algorithms can also identify common areas regardless of how responders identified themselves.

- 2020 data is comming soon!

All of these dataset is public and the data has been released under a CC 2.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0

These datasets are suitable for addressing my motivation because I want to learn about how other data scientists or machine learning practitioners approach problems, tools, datasets, or cloud services. 


### Unknowns
I am not sure when the 2020 version is coming out. If it does not come out, I can just work on the previous datasets.
